`react-geo` is a JavaScript library providing a large number of components to build modern mapping applications. It is used in combination with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [OpenLayers](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers) and [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design).

## Installation

```javascript static
npm i --save @terrestris/react-geo
```

## Usage

For a full list of available components, their properties and examples see [here](https://terrestris.github.io/react-geo/docs/latest/index.html).

### TypeScript

The `react-geo` package includes TypeScript declarations as `*.d.ts` files. The build itself is included in ESM format (currently ES2022).

### Styling

`react-geo` supports dynamic theming [via CSS variables](https://4x.ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme-variable) and requires the following import inside your project.

```css
@import '~antd/dist/antd.variable.min.css';
```
